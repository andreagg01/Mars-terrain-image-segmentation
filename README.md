# Mars-terrain-image-segmentation
Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning techniques for semantic segmentation on grayscale real images from Mars terrain:

Implementation of a Deep Learning model able to correctly apply semantic segmentation on grayscale real images from Mars terrain with Keras and Tensorflow. Pixels in these images were categorized into five classes, each representing a particular type of terrain. The goal was to assign the correct class label to each mask pixel. The model was tested and evaluated according to the mean intersection over union metric, given the set of
classes, the ground truth, and the model predictions; The model reached a final Mean IoU of 63% on augmented images.
